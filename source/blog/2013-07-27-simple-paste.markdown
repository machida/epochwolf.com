I made a little afternoon project called [Simple Paste](http://sp.ew.vc). It's a pastebin for plain text instead of code. I was sick of trying to use gist or pastie.org for plain text. Neither of them handle plain text nicely. Simple Paste simply escapes all special characters and applies no formating other than a tiny bit of css. 

I wrote it in php so I could host it on my VPS which already has php installed for dokuwiki. The source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/epochwolf/simple-paste).
