I've been working on a fantasy story set in Japan in the 1700s, known as Edo Period Japan. 
There's a lot of stuff on the internet about that era but most of it is depressingly topical.
You don't get a lot of feel for the culture.

As an entry into your own research, I'm going to recommend a book, a documentary, and a Wikipedia article to start with.
Together, they made it possible for me to imagine a fantasy Japan set in the late 1700s. 
I'll also cover some additional internet resources that you can use to flesh out your own story.

# [Everyday Life in Traditional Japan][0] <small>(Book)</small>

This is basically a small textbook. It's pretty small at 208 pages. Easy finished in a couple of evenings. 
It's a bit hit or miss topic wise. 

Starts off with some history and then dives into the different social classes, and then meanders into random facts. 
There's a lot of nice little details on how farming was done, how houses were laid out, and some details on the food of the time. 
I found meals to be especially interesting. Ideally they are silent, quick, and boring affairs. 
Talking during a meal in the Edo Period is rude. 
This isn't medieval Europe with roaring fires, groaning banquet tables, and busty tavern wenches!

# [Japan: Memoirs of a Secret Empire][1] <small>(DVD)</small>

Made up of 3 hour-long documentaries, it's pretty easy to set through. 
The voices of the narrators, readers, and professors are pleasant to listen to unlike some other PBS productions. 

The documentaries evenly cover a mixture of history, politics, and culture. 
It paints with a much broader brush than *Everyday Life in Traditional Japan*. 
At the same time it covers topics the book doesn't mention in detail such as the toll roads and geisha.

# [Shinto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto) <small>(Wikipedia)</small>

Neither the book nor the documentary really cover the Shinto religion in any great detail. 
It's a huge influence on Japanese both now and in the 1700s. 
I recommend reading this after seeing the two resources above. 
This wikipedia article fills out some of the gaps in understanding specific rituals like the [tea ceremony][2].

Reading about the tea ceremony without a cultural background isn't going to do much for your story. 
It's not just having a beer on the porch!

# Other Resources
Now that you have a baseline to start from, here's some articles I think you would find useful or at least interesting.
You can skip the food ones if you don't plan on covering meals in detail. Remember, meals are boring!

* [Japanese values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_values) <small>(Wikipedia)</small>

* [Japanese Single Family Houses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minka) <small>(Wikipedia)</small>

## Female Characters

Women in the Edo Period weren't valued as much as they were in previous or later periods.
They really don't have much information on them. I was forced to look at other eras for what a woman in my story could look like. 

* [Female Warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onna-bugeisha) <small>(Wikipedia)</small>
* [A 12th century Female Samurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen) <small>(Wikipedia)</small>
