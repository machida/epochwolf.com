I'm a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer and hobbyist writer in Bothell, WA.

I'm a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy. I'm always reading something in one of those genres. Once in a while, I'll pick up a biography or a text book. The biggest thing I miss from college is the ability to take classes outside of my normal field of study.

# My hobbies

* Reading books
* Writing short fiction
* Doing research for my writing
* Watch a documentary
* Work on [programming projects](/projects/)

Even though these are very solitary hobbies, I still make time to hang out with other people. Tuesday nights, I head to Greenwood and hang out with one of the many writing groups in the area. And I'm always on Freenode's IRC network.
