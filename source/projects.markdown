A selection of programming projects I've done through out the years. 

[This Website](https://github.com/epochwolf/epochwolf.com)
: Yup, I wrote this site myself using [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), a static site generator. 
Currently hosted on a linode vps.

[LitSocial](https://github.com/epochwolf/litsocial)
: A website for writers to share their stories and people to read them. 
Not finished yet. It's been a work in progress since [2010](https://github.com/epochwolf/singleforest-old). 
It's a hobby project I rebuild every year or so to keep my rails skills sharp. 

[Simple Paste](https://github.com/epochwolf/simple-paste)
: A plain text pastebin. I got annoyed with how pastie.org handled plain text so I wrote my own solution in 3 hours. I used php since I already had it installed on my VPS and wouldn't require much server configuration. 

[Pious Plum](https://github.com/epochwolf/pious-plum)
: IRC Bot written in Node.JS. I built it to learn how to use Node.JS. 
I found Node.JS much better suited for building bots than ruby or lua. 

[GodGamePurple](https://github.com/epochwolf/godgamepurple)
: Sabot rewritten in Ruby. 

[Sabot](https://github.com/epochwolf/sabot)
: IRC Bot written in pure lua. It has event based architecture and plug ins
