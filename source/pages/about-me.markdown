I'm a Ruby on Rails developer and hobbyist writer in Bothell, WA. 

My day job is writing insurance software for Vertafore. At night, I read a book, watch a documentary, or work on one of my programming or writing projects. Tuesday nights, I head to a cafe north of Seattle and hang out with one of the many writing groups in the area. 

Online, I hang out on irc.freenode.net in the #rubyonrails channel and on [twitter](http://twitter.com/epochwolf).

# Programming

[This Blog](https://github.com/epochwolf/epochwolf.com)
: Yup, I wrote this blog myself using [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), a static site generator. 
Currently hosted on a linode vps.

[LitSocial](https://github.com/epochwolf/litsocial)
: A website for writers to share their stories and people to read them. 
Not finished yet. It's been a work in progress since [2010](https://github.com/epochwolf/singleforest-old). 
It's a hobby project I rebuild every year or so as I learn more. 

[Pious Plum](https://github.com/epochwolf/pious-plum)
: IRC Bot written in Node.JS. I built it to learn how to use Node.JS. 
I found Node.JS much better suited for building bots than ruby or lua. 

[GodGamePurple](https://github.com/epochwolf/godgamepurple)
: Sabot rewritten in Ruby. 

[Sabot](https://github.com/epochwolf/sabot)
: IRC Bot written in pure lua. It has event based architecture and plug ins

# Writing

Most of my writing is for my own enjoyment. I don't have many stories longer than 2,000 words. A few of them are hosted here.
